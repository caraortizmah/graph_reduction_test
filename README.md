### sprint function test

how to run:
python bcn_wulff.py list_xyz.txt

where `list_xyz.txt` is the list of the .xyz files
that will be presented to sprint() to calculate tthe
new coordinates.
This list should be placed in the path where this
script (`bcn_wulff.py`) is running
The output will be in the `list_sprints.txt` file
each row has the name of the file and the sprint 
coordinates as a vector
